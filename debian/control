Description: C++ header-only library for mathematical optimization
 Ensmallen provides a simple set of abstractions for writing an objective
 function to optimize. It also provides a large set of standard and cutting-edge
 optimizers that can be used for virtually any mathematical optimization task.
 These include full-batch gradient descent techniques, small-batch techniques,
 gradient-free optimizers, and constrained optimization.
